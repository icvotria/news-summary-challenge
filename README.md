This is the Makers week 7 weekend challenge. The goal was to create an app that shows the latest news using the Guardian API. 
Further details of the challenge can be found in the CHALLENGE.md file.

- All basic user stories met 

## Failures!

- I couldn't work out how to test the search functionality
- I didn't do any of the stretch user stories
- The displayNews function is a million lines long and I'm not sure how to refactor it
